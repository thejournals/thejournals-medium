# Night out with Cousins
## August 26, 2018

Went to SM Lipa Cinema to watch [Crazy Rich Asians](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3104988/) with my cousins (Pam, Bea and Poy). I really enjoyed the movie. Most of the scenes are on point and a glimpse of what being a rich chinese life is like. It's so good! I definitely recommend this movie to all!

Anyways, after the movie we when to a place to had catch-up and laughs. Being the eldest cousin, I'm going 30 next year and my cousins were 16 and 18. A huge gap between us and I've been waiting for them to grow up to have bondings like this. I just don't know if this will be a thing again because they will be going to college and all. It's just hard to find time with them again. Time really flies so fast.

We went to Starbucks that night to have a coffee then decided to went back to home at 12am.

That's all folks.

*P.S. I have so much stories to tell that I forgot to write about them. I'll share it one day.*
