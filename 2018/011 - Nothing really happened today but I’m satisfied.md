# Nothing really happened today but I’m satisfied
## August 19, 2018

Yeah. Nothing really happened surprising today but I managed to download some stuffs that I could start **re**learn for the next past few days. Last year, I’ve subscribed and bought some tutorials on *[a cloud guru](https://acloud.guru)* about **[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com)**. Through 3 months of study, I was able to learn more about the future of the *cloud*. Then I stopped. I stopped because in that same year, a lot happened from work which I did not have any much time to focus on the tutorials. I slacked too and enjoyed few parties. Focused my time on applying on companies and for the past 6 months was just work.

So, I’m starting to download the three tutorials and trying to make use of my [Github](https://www.github.com) or [Gitlab](https://www.gitlab.com) account. On top of that, I will start learning JAVA which my tito always say that I should learn it because it is on-demand in other countries. I know I tried to stay away from programming but if it will make me earn dollars then why not return back. Right? Right?

Tomorrow is Monday and I’m really not excited. I need more sleep! Seriously. I will try to check out Netflix after this post and find few documentaries to watch.

I will try to come-up of an idea on how to bring back my podcast called “[Barkada Therapy](https://open.spotify.com/show/3G2v0gVSOLN8QlFj3ae8mW?si=rwF5kJy8SlmKyuzm5tMX-A)” which is on Spotify. Go check it out now.

That’s all for today folks.
