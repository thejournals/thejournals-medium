# Re-organizing myself for the nth time
## August 18, 2018

Trying to focus on this write-up while sitting in this crowded Starbucks. Loud, chaotic, people laughing out loud embraces while eating a warm french toast. I can survive this place. White hot chocolate is my go-to drink during this cozy, cold and messy weather. 

I also had a quick chat with Chichay, a barista here in Starbucks whom I’ve known through a friend. I asked her if she’s really wanted to join Familia Liberica to practice and train MMA. Just recovered from arm injury and insisting to join a somewhat dangerous training is just badass and crazy. What can I say? She’s really into stuffs like that and I know because I’ve seen her destroy the trainer in the boxing ring. I don’t personally know her that much but based from what I’ve seen through social posts and friends, she is amazing. I can say more than 100 things about her that will make men like her immediately.

Called *Dina* about what she’s doing right now and all. I hope and pray she will be okay on what’s happening about her life right now. I know right now the struggles she had is just temporary and good things will come sooner or later. It’s just a matter of time.

Anyways, I really had an tiring week due to lack sleep deprivation. Averaging 2h 30m sleep this week if really just sad. Which made me think, should I really start living in Manila? Is it really the best thing to do to save my body from **exhaustion**?

Thankfully there’s a holiday next week, I could rest and start doing the lectures that my tito gave me.

I also had a talk with one person whom I’ve known years back. Initially, I asked few questions which was too personal to share. I think it was 1 hour long or less of pure good conversation about our opinions and experiences.

Today was a good day. I had plenty of sleep, able to talk to few people and able to write again. I will try to make this a habit. So, that’s it for today folks.

*On the side note, I’m writing this on Ulysses (iPad). Have not touched this app for a long time. Glad to I could use this again.*
